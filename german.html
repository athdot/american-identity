&emsp;&emsp;America is a country of many cultures and peoples, and without these different peoples, America wouldn’t be what it is today. People from the Region of Germany were a major influence to the peoples, and the cultures of the United States ever since the Founding of our Country. From Revolutionary Hessians to Immigrants seeking a new hope after the Unification of Germany, Germans have made their mark on this country. 
<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In the 1770’s, Hessians (German Mercenaries) paid for by the English Crown, came to the American Colonies to help the Redcoats suppress the Revolution. This addition of German soldiers only added to the Difficulty for the Americans to escape the pull of the Crown. This difficulty gave the Revolutionaries more will to win, and a new sense of Independence in American Culture. The Defeat of Nazi Germany also fueled this sense of American Independence and Freedom. In the century after the Revolution, Germans would slowly start to pour into America looking for more places to get land and farm, as land at home was hard to get. All of these immigrants, by simply coming to the United States, brought several popular items that still exist even today! Kindergarten (Literally translated to Children Garden) is one thing that Germans brought to America, as well as Hamburgers and Hot Dogs. Of all the popular things in America brought by the Germans, the most popular is the tradition of having a Christmas Tree to go with the holiday. Not only did the Germans influence the United States with their Culture and Historical Influences, but they also impacted us through Music as well!<br clear="right"/><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Johann_Sebastian_Bach.jpg/260px-Johann_Sebastian_Bach.jpg" height="400" align="right" alt="Music" HSPACE="50" VSPACE="50" />
<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Great German composers such as Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Handel, and even Hans Zimmer (The Man behind the soundtracks for many Iconic movies such as Interstellar, Pirates of the Caribbean: Black Pearl, The Da Vinci code, and much more), have contributed greatly to the music Americans listened to and currently listen to. Classical music was practically invented by the Germans and today, almost everyone in the world has heard some form of their music. Many of today's music compositions are inspired, and based off of the principles made by these great composers that lived and died nearly three centuries ago!
<br><br>&emsp;&emsp;America owes a great part of its culture to German-Americans, and just Germans in General. Even our language, English, was made in part by Germans! Just look around, and you can see that the United States is brimming with Germans and people with Germanic Heritage. Germans clearly contributed lots to what it means to be an American, and it just makes America the way it is today!
