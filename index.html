<h3 style="">A Blend of Cultures</h3>
<hr style="border-color: grey;">
America is a diverse place of Love, Liberty, and Happiness, but where would it be without all of its people's and their Cultures? America was born a country of immigrants from a far off land, in a place they knew nothing about. With each generation, more came to help support the country, and soon America was blossoming with people of Almost all nationalities! With these people come their culture. Each one brought a little peice of their homeland with them, whether it be Great Britain, Germany, Japan, or even Italy, and when they did this, they added onto the heritage and culture of America, one by one. A few of the more prominent influences on what it means to be an American in this day and age were brought over by three specific groups. The French, The Germans, and The Russians.

<h4>What does it Mean to be an American?</h4>
&emsp;&emsp;There is no other Country in this World like the United States of America. None as diverse. None as Culturally mixed. This America is unique. A hodgepodge of different Peoples, Cultures, and Ethnicities. All of it came together into a sense of Identity. What it meant to the People to be America. Every time a person immigrated from their home country, they brought a little part of their culture. Some literature, art, or music. A little piece of home. All coming together to become the American Identity.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;Ever since the beginning of the United States of America, it got itself influenced from other nations. Influenced by Documents, and Civilisations that existed thousands of years before the United States of America existed, gave a little bit of themselves to create the Country we know today. From the Magna Carta, and the English Bill of Rights in the United Kingdom of old, to the French, as a result of their rivalry with the British, supporting America in their revolution, America was given ideas on how to run itself. All of this influence and support from the countries of Europe came together, and created the beginning of an Identity of what America is. This is the moment in time where we get the famed American sense of liberty, and what it means to be free. Every time someone new came, some new stories and folk tales originated, and the culture was changed. The Dutch that came brought their superstitions and stories. The Colonists brought their distaste in Monarchies and belief in people’s rights, from their hardships in the past. Every person contributed, little by little until it became the Culture we know today.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;To be American is to make a change, and make good changes. Being American is being welcoming, being caring about other people, and being proud of your country. It’s forgiveness. It’s not holding grudges on anything, and being kind. Everywhere you look in America, you can see that this is what we strive for; its who America wants to be. The Boy Scouts have a Scout Law. It states that a Scout is Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean, and Reverent. It means that we should be the best person that we can be, no matter what happens. The US Constitution states that Americans have unalienable rights, such as Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. It shows that even from the beginning of our country, it was what we wanted. Being American means protection by the law. Anyone can say whatever they want, without fear of repercussion. The US Constitution’s first Amendment states five Freedoms that everyone can’t be denied. The freedoms of Religion, Speech, Press, Peaceable Assembly, and being able to Address their Grievances to the Government. This is what America wants as a people, and though everyone might not follow through, it is what America, and the American Identity means. This Identity is also defined through Culture.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;As a result of the hodgepodge of Peoples in the United States of America, the Culture is something of its own. Art in America is a blend of styles from all around the world. It is something new. It is only natural that Literature, and Stories are a blend as well. Government documents have ideas from people that came from all over the world, and even books and reading have people, and ideas that originated from a hodgepodge of peoples old countries, and cultures. Even in the media, everything is catered to speak to everyone, no matter their background. All of this makes American Literature, Media, and even Art Unique and very different from the rest of the world. This style of expressing themselves has even changed over time.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;In the beginning of American Culture, everything that existed, came from some far off European Civilisation. All the art. All the books. Everything. As time went by, and more and more people immigrated, the people started to create. In the beginning, it was much like the Culture of Britain, and other prominent European Powers. But as even more time passed, people started to change. New ideas came, and were changed by the immigrants coming from all over the world. Soon American culture went from a clone of Europes to a complete new Culture, never seen before. We went from traditional english writing to Catch 22, and Moby Dick. Some people even created new Genres of writing, like Transcendentalism. The US wasn’t always as Unique and as different as it is now, but over time, we became a complete new thing of our own.
<br>&emsp;&emsp;The United States of America is about as different and Unique as it comes. No other countries can quite match our diversity. A hodgepodge of different Peoples, Cultures, and Ethnicities all came together to create the Identity of America we all know and love now. Every time a person moved from their home country, they brought with them a tiny part of their culture. Something different. A little piece of home. All of it coming together into one big America.
