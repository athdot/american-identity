<h3 style="">A Blend of Cultures</h3>
<hr style="border-color: grey;">
America is a diverse place of Love, Liberty, and Happiness, but where would it be without all of its people's and their Cultures? America was born a country of immigrants from a far off land, in a place they knew nothing about. With each generation, more came to help support the country, and soon America was blossoming with people of Almost all nationalities! With these people come their culture. Each one brought a little peice of their homeland with them, whether it be Great Britain, Germany, Japan, or even Italy, and when they did this, they added onto the heritage and culture of America, one by one.
